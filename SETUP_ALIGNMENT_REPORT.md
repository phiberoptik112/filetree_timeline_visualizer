# Setup Script Alignment Report

## Overview
This report documents the alignment issues found between `setup.sh` and the current codebase containerization, along with the fixes applied.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing Dockerfiles
**Issue**: Setup script referenced `Dockerfile.unified-backend` and `Dockerfile.scanner` that didn't exist in the codebase.

**Fix**: 
- Added automatic creation of `Dockerfile.unified-backend` and `Dockerfile.scanner` in the `verify_dockerfiles()` function
- These Dockerfiles are now created with proper configurations for Kubernetes deployment

#### 2. Incorrect Path References
**Issue**: Existing Dockerfiles used incorrect directory paths (`file-tree-timeline` instead of `file_tree_timeline`).

**Fix**:
- Updated `Dockerfile.backend` to use correct paths:
  - `file-tree-timeline/backend/requirements.txt` â†’ `requirements.txt`
  - `file-tree-timeline/backend/` â†’ `file_tree_timeline/`
- Updated `Dockerfile.frontend` to use correct paths:
  - `file-tree-timeline/frontend/` â†’ `file_tree_timeline/frontend/`

#### 3. Hardcoded Paths in docker-compose.yaml
**Issue**: Docker Compose file contained hardcoded user-specific paths that wouldn't work for other users.

**Fix**:
- Updated `docker-compose.yaml` to use relative paths and sample data
- Added interactive prompt in setup script to allow users to update paths
- Changed from `/Users/jakepfitsch/Documents/sample_project_databaseWork/Project_1_Acoustic_Design/` to `./file_tree_timeline/sample_data/example_project`

### ðŸŸ¡ Minor Issues

#### 1. Missing Error Handling
**Issue**: Setup script didn't validate that required files existed before proceeding.

**Fix**:
- Added `validate_project_structure()` function to check for required files and directories
- Added proper error handling in `prepare_minikube_images()` function

#### 2. Inconsistent Docker Image Building
**Issue**: Kubernetes deployment script expected specific Docker images that weren't being built.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `prepare_minikube_images()` function with proper error checking
- Added validation for each Dockerfile before building

## Current Architecture Alignment

### Docker Compose Environment
- **Backend**: Uses `Dockerfile.backend` with unified backend
- **Frontend**: Uses `Dockerfile.frontend` with nginx serving unified visualizer
- **Volumes**: Shared data volume for communication between services
- **Ports**: Frontend exposed on port 8080

### Kubernetes Environment
- **Unified Backend**: `Dockerfile.unified-backend` with health checks and resource limits
- **Scanner**: `Dockerfile.scanner` for file system scanning
- **Frontend**: `Dockerfile.frontend` with load balancing
- **Backup**: `Dockerfile.backup` for automated backups
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for data and backups
- **Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers configured

## Files Modified

### 1. setup.sh
- Added project structure validation
- Enhanced Dockerfile verification and creation
- Improved error handling and user guidance
- Added interactive path configuration for docker-compose.yaml

### 2. Dockerfile.backend
- Fixed requirements.txt path
- Updated directory paths to match actual structure

### 3. Dockerfile.frontend
- Fixed directory paths
- Removed hardcoded JSON file copy

### 4. docker-compose.yaml
- Replaced hardcoded paths with relative paths
- Updated to use sample data directory
- Simplified command structure

### 5. New Files Created
- `Dockerfile.unified-backend` (for Kubernetes deployment)
- `Dockerfile.scanner` (for Kubernetes deployment)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Docker Compose Testing
```bash
# Test the updated setup
./setup.sh --auto

# Verify containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs
```

### 2. Kubernetes Testing
```bash
# Test Kubernetes deployment
cd k8s
./deploy.sh deploy

# Verify deployment
kubectl get all -n filetree-timeline
```

### 3. Path Validation
```bash
# Verify Dockerfiles use correct paths
grep -r "file_tree_timeline" Dockerfile.*

# Verify no hardcoded paths remain
grep -r "/Users/" docker-compose.yaml
```

## Future Improvements

### 1. Configuration Management
- Consider using environment variables for configurable paths
- Add support for custom data directories via command line arguments

### 2. Multi-Environment Support
- Add support for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Create environment-specific docker-compose files

### 3. Validation Enhancements
- Add validation for Docker image builds
- Add health check validation for running containers
- Add performance testing for large datasets

## Conclusion

The setup script is now properly aligned with the current codebase containerization. All critical issues have been resolved, and the script provides a robust setup process for both Docker Compose and Kubernetes environments. The changes maintain backward compatibility while improving portability and user experience.
